12. read about gzip/deflate
hw expected result: what is difference? a txt file.


Deflate is a compression method and compressed data format. There is no additional information in a deflate stream such as file names, check values, etc. It is encoding of a string of bytes. 
Gzip is a wrapper for the deflate format. It provides those missing items mentioned, such as file name, modification time, and check values. Only one deflate stream can be present in a gzip stream, and so effectively can represent only one file.
